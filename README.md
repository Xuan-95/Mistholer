# Mistholer

## About the Name

**Mistholer** is a composition of **Mis**ner, **Tho**rne, and Whee**ler** — the three physicists who authored the monumental textbook *Gravitation* (1973):

- **Charles W. Misner**
- **Kip S. Thorne**
- **John Archibald Wheeler**

Their collaborative work represents one of the most comprehensive treatments of general relativity ever written, known for its depth, rigor, and pedagogical approach.

## Philosophy

This project follows the philosophy embodied in *Gravitation*: **start from the fundamentals and progressively build understanding layer by layer**. 

The goal is to understand how the physics engine works under the hood — not just at the surface level, but by diving deep into the mathematical and conceptual foundations, exploring each layer of abstraction until the full picture emerges.

Just as Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler guided readers from basic principles to the frontiers of gravitational physics, Mistholer aims to build knowledge from the ground up.
